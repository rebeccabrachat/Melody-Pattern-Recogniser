# Melody-Pattern-Recogniser
This project is part of the C++ II course in my Masters at University of Berne.
The goal is to search and find user specific melody patterns in a given song.

The project requires two different libs: MusicXML and GuidoLib

Find guidoLib here: https://github.com/grame-cncm/guidolib
